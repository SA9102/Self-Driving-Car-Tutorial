# :car: Self-Driving Car

My work from a tutorial I am following, which teaches how to create a simulation of a car that drives on its own using neural networks. The tutorial does not use any machine learning libraries.

The purpose of following this tutorial is to learn how neural networks work, which is an important part of machine learning.

Use the arrow keys to control the car.

## What I have learnt

- How to use linear interpolation to create rays.
- How to get the coordinates of the intersection between two lines (uses linear interpolation). Used in ray casting.
